I started coding in 1981 on a [Texas TI-58C programmable calculator](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/30_anni_casasoft/texasti58c.php)

For this "computer" I wrote various programs; one of them, a tool for using undocumented instructions, was [published on the italian magazine MCmicrocomputer](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc20articolo.pdf)

Next I had a [Commodore 64](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/30_anni_casasoft/commodore64.php). I wrote a lot a programs for this computer; some of them was published:

- An accounting management program, "Gestione C/C" [published on MCmicrcomputer in march 1984](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc28articolo-1.pdf) and [second page](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc28articolo-2.pdf)

- A game, "Serpentone" [published on MCmicrcomputer in april 1984](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc29articolo.pdf)
