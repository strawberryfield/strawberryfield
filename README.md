I started coding in 1981 on a [Texas TI-58C programmable calculator](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/30_anni_casasoft/texasti58c.php)

For this "computer" I wrote various programs; one of them, a tool for using undocumented instructions, was [published on the italian magazine MCmicrocomputer](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc20articolo.pdf)

Next I had a [Commodore 64](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/30_anni_casasoft/commodore64.php). I wrote a lot a programs for this computer; some of them was published:

- An accounting management program, "Gestione C/C" [published on MCmicrcomputer in march 1984](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc28articolo-1.pdf) and [second page](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc28articolo-2.pdf)

- A game, "Serpentone" [published on MCmicrcomputer in april 1984](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/mc/mc29articolo.pdf)

- A little suite of text management utilities [broadcasted on the Italian national radio RAI](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/rai/main_intervista1.mp3) in march 1985

- SoSyA, an astronomical tool presented as a thesis in the high school final exam and also [broadcasted on the Italian national radio RAI](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/rai/main_intervista2.mp3) in may 1985

Twenty years later I published an article on the italian magazine **Computer Programming** in which I described [how to prepare a video dvd using command line tools](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/creare_dvd_video/index.php)

Here are hosted the most recent works, especially the [Contemporary Carte de Visite tools](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/carte_de_visite/index.php) are described on my site along with the [resulting photos](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/creditcards/index.php) which have been exhibited in [important exhibitions](https://strawberryfield.altervista.org/bicingiro/index.php) and are now kept at the national museum of photography in Brescia
